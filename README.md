## Project title

Forrrest Theme for WordPress

## Motivation

Building a wee theme for garden enthusiasts without the use of Advanced Custom Fields -- wanted to see how much I could experiment with the customizer UI and Gutenberg editors. Also a bit of a playground for me to experiment with other aspects of WordPress.
